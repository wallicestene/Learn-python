# Python Learning Journey üêç

This is my personal workspace where I'm learning Python programming and exploring various programming concepts. It serves as a practice ground for different topics and exercises as I progress through my coding journey.

## üéØ Topics I've Covered

### Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if statements, while/for loops)
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- String manipulation and formatting
- File operations and path handling
- Error handling with try/except blocks

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Constructor methods and instance variables

### Advanced Python Concepts
- List comprehensions and lambda functions
- Module importing and package creation
- Working with external libraries
- API consumption and JSON data handling
- Random number generation
- Regular expressions and string processing

### Additional Skills
- JavaScript basics and Node.js
- Excel automation and data processing
- HTTP requests and web APIs
